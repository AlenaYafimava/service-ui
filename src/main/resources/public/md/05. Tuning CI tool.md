[ ![Image](Images/pic_237.png) ](Images/pic_237.png)

Please setup parameters in accordance with your Report Portal instance.

**Rest endpoint** – value for using Report Portal endpoint with specified URL and port to. By default, value equals EPAM Report Portal production instance available from external network.

**Project** – name of using project where job logs launches.

**Launch name** – full name of logged launch from automation tests configuration.

**Username** – username of specified user for access to Report Portal with configured project.

**Password** – password for specified above username.

In general - all configuration parameters should be specified **the same as for automation project** at current Jenkins job.

>   We strongly recommend have separate internal user for Jenkins jobs at the Report Portal system.

>   You could test connection to server by click on ‘Test ReportPortal Connection’ button. If connection was successful – ‘Connection successfully established’ message will appear or ‘Connection with ReportPortal RESTful interface could not be established!’ warning message will appear instead.
